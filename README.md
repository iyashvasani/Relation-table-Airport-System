### What is Relational Model?

**Relational Model (RM)** represents the database as a collection of relations. 
A relation is nothing but a table of values. Every row in the table represents
a collection of related data values. These rows in the table denote a real-world 
entity or relationship.

The table name and column names are helpful to interpret the meaning of values in 
each row. The data are represented as a set of relations. In the relational model, 
data are stored as tables. However, the physical storage of the data is independent 
of the way the data are logically organized.
